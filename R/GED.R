#' UCDP Georeferenced Event Dataset (GED) Global version 20.1
#'
#' This dataset is UCDP's most disaggregated dataset, covering
#' individual events of organized violence (phenomena of lethal
#' violence occurring at a given time and place). These events
#' are sufficiently fine-grained to be geo-coded down to the
#' level of individual villages, with temporal durations
#' disaggregated to single, individual days.
